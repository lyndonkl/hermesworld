# Systems Thinking & Leverage Points

Finds high-leverage intervention points in a complex system by mapping its feedback loops,
recognising known system archetypes (fixes that fail, shifting the burden, tragedy of the commons,
limits to growth), and ranking candidate interventions on Meadows' leverage hierarchy. It produces
a system map and a ranked intervention strategy. It does not simulate the system numerically; the
output is a defended causal argument, not a model run.

## When to Use

- The problem involves interconnected components with feedback loops, delays, or emergent
  behaviour.
- Past solutions failed or caused unintended consequences.
- You need to decide where to push for maximum effect with limited effort.
- A strategy rests on a reinforcing loop (a flywheel) and you need to name the conditions under
  which it runs backwards.
- The user mentions systems thinking, leverage points, feedback loops, causal loop diagrams,
  stocks and flows, or complex systems.

## Procedure

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Systems Thinking & Leverage Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Define system and problem
- [ ] Step 2: Map system structure
- [ ] Step 3: Identify leverage points
- [ ] Step 4: Validate and test interventions
- [ ] Step 5: Design high-leverage strategy
```

**Step 1: Define system and problem**

Clarify system boundaries (what is in and out of the system), key variables (stocks that
accumulate, flows that change them), and problem symptom vs. underlying pattern. Use the
[System Definition](#system-definition) section below.

**Step 2: Map system structure**

For simple cases → use [templates/template.md](templates/template.md) for a quick causal loop
diagram and stock-flow identification. For complex cases → study
[references/methodology.md](references/methodology.md) for system archetypes, multi-loop analysis,
and time delays.

**Step 3: Identify leverage points**

Apply Meadows' leverage hierarchy (parameters < buffers < structure < delays < balancing loops <
reinforcing loops < information < rules < self-organization < goals < paradigms). See
[Leverage Points Analysis](#leverage-points-analysis) below and
[references/methodology.md](references/methodology.md) for techniques.

**Step 4: Validate and test interventions**

Self-assess using
[assets/evaluators/rubric_systems_thinking_leverage.json](assets/evaluators/rubric_systems_thinking_leverage.json).
Test mental models: what happens if we push here? What are the second-order effects? What delays
might undermine the intervention? See [Verification](#verification).

**Step 5: Design high-leverage strategy**

Write `systems-thinking-leverage.md` with `write_file`: system map, leverage point ranking,
recommended interventions, and predicted outcomes. See [Delivery Format](#delivery-format).

## System Definition

Before mapping, clarify:

**1. System Boundary**
- **What is inside the system?** (components you are analyzing)
- **What is outside?** (external forces you cannot control)
- **Why this boundary?** (pragmatic scope for intervention)

**2. Key Variables**
- **Stocks**: Things that accumulate (employee count, technical debt, customer base, trust,
  knowledge)
- **Flows**: Rates of change (hiring rate, bug introduction rate, churn rate, relationship
  building rate)
- **Goals**: What the system is trying to achieve (may be implicit)

**3. Time Horizon**
- **Short-term** (weeks-months): Focus on flows and immediate feedback
- **Long-term** (years): Focus on stocks, paradigms, and structural change

**4. Problem Statement**
- **Symptom**: What is the observable issue? (e.g., "customer churn is 30%/year")
- **Pattern**: What is the recurring dynamic? (e.g., "onboarding improvements work briefly then
  churn returns")
- **Hypothesis**: What feedback loop might explain this? (e.g., "quick onboarding sacrifices depth
  → users don't see value → churn → pressure for faster onboarding")

## Leverage Points Analysis

**Meadows' 12 Leverage Points** (ascending order of effectiveness):

**12. Parameters** (weak) - Constants, numbers (tax rates, salaries, prices)
- Easy to change, low resistance
- Effects are linear and temporary
- Example: Increase training budget 20%

**11. Buffers** - Stock sizes relative to flows (reserves, inventories)
- Larger buffers increase stability but reduce responsiveness
- Example: Increase runway from 6 to 12 months

**10. Stock-and-Flow Structures** - Physical system design
- Hard to change once built (buildings, infrastructure)
- Example: Redesign office for collaboration vs. heads-down work

**9. Delays** - Time lags in information flows
- Reducing delays improves responsiveness (if the system is agile)
- Too-short delays can cause instability
- Example: Daily feedback vs. annual reviews

**8. Balancing Feedback Loops** - Strength of stabilizing forces
- Weaken to enable growth, strengthen to prevent overshoot
- Example: Make incident post-mortems blameless (weaken fear loop)

**7. Reinforcing Feedback Loops** - Strength of amplifying forces
- Strengthen positive loops (learning), weaken negative loops (burnout)
- Example: Invest in developer tools → faster builds → more experiments → better tools

**6. Information Flows** - Who has access to what information
- Make consequences visible to those who can act
- Example: Show developers the support tickets caused by their code

**5. Rules** - Incentives, constraints, punishments
- Shape what behaviors are rewarded
- Example: Tie bonuses to team outcomes not individual metrics

**4. Self-Organization** - Power to add/change/evolve structure
- Enable the system to adapt and evolve
- Example: Let teams choose their own tools and processes

**3. Goals** - Purpose the system serves
- Changing goals redirects the entire system
- Example: Shift from "ship features fast" to "solve user problems sustainably"

**2. Paradigms** - Mindset from which the system arises
- Assumptions, worldview, mental models
- Example: Shift from "employees are costs" to "employees are investors of human capital"

**1. Transcending Paradigms** (strongest) - Ability to shift between paradigms
- Meta-level: recognizing paradigms are just one lens
- Example: Hold "growth" and "sustainability" paradigms simultaneously, choose contextually

**How to Use This Hierarchy:**
1. List all possible intervention points
2. Classify each by leverage level (1-12)
3. Prioritize high-leverage interventions (1-7) over low-leverage (8-12)
4. Consider feasibility: high leverage often faces high resistance

## Common System Archetypes

If the system matches these patterns, the leverage points are well known:

**Fixes That Fail**
- **Pattern**: Quick fix works initially → Problem returns → Rely more on fix → Problem worsens
- **Example**: Crunch time to meet deadline → Technical debt → Future deadlines harder → More
  crunch time
- **Leverage**: Address root cause (schedule realism), not symptom (work hours)

**Shifting the Burden**
- **Pattern**: Symptomatic solution (easy) used instead of fundamental solution (hard) →
  Fundamental solution atrophies → More dependent on symptomatic solution
- **Example**: Hire contractors (symptomatic) vs. grow internal capability (fundamental)
- **Leverage**: Invest in fundamental solution, gradually reduce symptomatic solution

**Tragedy of the Commons**
- **Pattern**: Shared resource → Each actor maximizes individual gain → Resource depletes →
  Everyone suffers
- **Example**: Shared codebase → Each team adds dependencies → Build time explodes
- **Leverage**: Make consequences visible (information flow), add usage limits (rules), or enable
  self-organization (governance)

**Limits to Growth**
- **Pattern**: Reinforcing growth → Hits limiting factor → Growth slows/reverses
- **Example**: Viral growth → Support overwhelmed → Poor experience → Negative word-of-mouth
- **Leverage**: Anticipate the limit, invest in expanding it before growth hits it

For more archetypes, see [references/methodology.md](references/methodology.md).

## Quick Reference

**Bundled files:**
- [templates/template.md](templates/template.md) - Quick-start for simple systems
- [references/methodology.md](references/methodology.md) - Advanced techniques, more archetypes,
  multi-loop analysis
- [assets/evaluators/rubric_systems_thinking_leverage.json](assets/evaluators/rubric_systems_thinking_leverage.json)
  - Quality criteria

**Key Concepts:**
- **Stocks**: Accumulations (nouns) - employee count, technical debt, trust
- **Flows**: Rates of change (verbs) - hiring rate, bug introduction rate
- **Reinforcing loops** (R): Amplify change (growth or collapse)
- **Balancing loops** (B): Resist change (goal-seeking, stabilizing)
- **Delays**: Time between cause and effect (minutes to years)
- **Leverage**: Where to intervene for maximum effect per effort

## Pitfalls

- Treating symptoms instead of root causes (low leverage)
- Ignoring feedback loops (interventions backfire)
- Missing delays (impatience, premature abandonment)
- Intervening at the wrong leverage point (pushing parameters when structure needs changing)
- Not anticipating unintended consequences (system pushback)
- Drawing a "flywheel" without naming what stops it: every reinforcing loop meets a balancing
  one eventually, and the analysis is incomplete until that loop is on the map

## Verification

Before finalizing, check:

**System Map Quality:**
- [ ] All major feedback loops identified (R for reinforcing, B for balancing)?
- [ ] Stocks and flows distinguished (nouns vs. verbs)?
- [ ] Delays explicitly noted (with estimated time lag)?
- [ ] System boundary clear (what is in and out)?
- [ ] Connections show polarity (+ same direction, - opposite direction)?

**Leverage Point Analysis:**
- [ ] Multiple intervention points considered (not just the first idea)?
- [ ] Each intervention classified by leverage level (1-12)?
- [ ] High-leverage interventions identified and prioritized?
- [ ] Trade-offs acknowledged (leverage vs. feasibility)?
- [ ] Second-order effects anticipated (what else changes)?

**Archetype Recognition** (if applicable):
- [ ] Does the system match a known archetype (fixes that fail, shifting the burden, tragedy of
      the commons, etc.)?
- [ ] If yes, what is the typical failure mode for this archetype?
- [ ] What is the high-leverage intervention for this archetype?

**Mental Model Testing:**
- [ ] What happens if we intervene at this leverage point?
- [ ] What are the unintended consequences (delays, compensating loops)?
- [ ] Will the system resist this intervention? How?
- [ ] What needs to change for the intervention to stick?
