"""
special.py — valuation models for companies the standard DCF cannot handle.

Five branches for the five kinds of company, plus the private-to-public step for a firm on
its way to an offering. Which branch applies is a routing decision the analyst makes before
running anything; the script does not guess. Each branch either produces a finished number
(a probability, a discount, a per-share equity value) or the driver payload that
`dcf-valuation-engine/resources/dcf.py value` consumes.

The engine computes. The end-state margin, the sustainable return on equity, the
probability of failure and the recovery percentage are judgments and arrive as inputs.

Pure standard library. No third-party packages, ever — this must run anywhere.

SUBCOMMANDS
  distress        bond price or rating -> probability of failure; blend the two branches
  excess-return   bank equity value = book equity + PV of returns above the cost of equity
  private         total beta for an undiversified owner; two illiquidity discounts
  ipo             the bridge from a private owner's value to an offer price, line by line
  cyclical        mid-cycle earnings; revenues at today's commodity price
  young-company   revenue-target and margin path -> a dcf.py payload plus survival odds
  selftest        run the bundled worked examples and report pass/fail

Each subcommand reads a JSON payload (--in FILE, or stdin) and writes JSON to stdout.
Run any subcommand with --example to print a sample input payload.
