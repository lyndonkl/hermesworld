"""
simulate.py — turn a point-estimate valuation into a distribution.

The base-case DCF is unchanged. This script replaces the two or three drivers you are
least sure about with probability distributions, runs the same engine thousands of times,
and reports the distribution of the answer: percentiles, mean, standard deviation, the
probability the value clears the market price, and the share of draws the engine refused
as infeasible.

The valuation itself is not reimplemented here. Every trial calls the DCF engine in
../../dcf-valuation-engine/resources/dcf.py, so the simulated model and the base-case
model are literally the same code.

A seed is required, not optional. A valuation that cannot be re-run to the same number
cannot be audited, and "I ran a simulation and got 42" is not a reproducible claim.

The output is a distribution of your assumptions, not a distribution of reality. Someone
chose every shape and every parameter in the input.

Pure standard library. No third-party packages, ever — this must run anywhere.

SUBCOMMANDS
  simulate     base case + driver distributions -> the value distribution
  sample       draw one or more distributions on their own, without the DCF
  scenarios    named discrete scenarios with probabilities -> probability-weighted value
  percentiles  a list of values, or a published percentile table -> stats and price position
  selftest     run the bundled worked examples and report pass/fail

Each subcommand reads a JSON payload (--in FILE, or stdin) and writes JSON to stdout.
Run any subcommand with --example to print a sample input payload.
